Graphical interface for the worm algorithm/Z(3) spin model.  

It shows in "real time" how the Monte Carlo program updates a 3 dimensional lattice.
We simulate the Z(3) spin model and use the worm algorithm for the update.

One can select the parameters:
Volume of the lattice
Model parameters (tau, kappa and mu)
MC parameters (equilibration steps (these steps are not shown), and number of steps to plot)

It is possible also to select the color coding (left click on the colored elements on the right
down part of the window).

To execute:  open Matlab, go to the directory where the matlab files are located and 
execute in Matlab: GUI_worm
